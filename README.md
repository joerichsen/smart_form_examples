# SmartForm Examples

This repo contains some examples of using the [SmartForm](https://hex.pm/packages/smart_form) hex package.

## Getting started
Start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
